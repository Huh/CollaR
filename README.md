## collar

This is a brand new package that is currently being built and tested.  Please follow this repository or read the NEWS function above to find out how things are going and the state of the project.

This package is the first in a series to make it easier to work with collar data.  Telemetry collar companies create the devices that collect data about animal movements and they also dictate the format of the data.  Unfortunately, there is not a single means of retrieving data, a consistent format or even similar types of information in the spreadsheets that proprietary software produces.  This package provides functionality to read csv files, standardize telemetry data and provide basic summary information.
